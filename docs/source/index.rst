TempoDB Python API documentation
================================

The tempodb-python library allows users of the Python language to connect to 
TempoDB's REST-based API to read and write data to their databases.  An 
introduction with examples can be found in the "examples and snippets" document 
below.  The other pages document the functions and classes in the API itself.
